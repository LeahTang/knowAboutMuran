          Working in the business development department, my main responsibility
          was data screening and analysis by Excel. In some projects, my job was
          to communicate with business managers. <br> <br>
          I have learned a lot from this internship. First thing is that focus on
          solving the problems instead of complaining about the person who made
          them. Second, I learned how to work happily and live seriously. Why
          not work seriously and live happily? In my opinion, The reason
          why many people think it should be written as 'serious work' is that
          traditionally, people see work as a task, a chore. So, one has to force
          oneself to be responsible. But, if people love their work, they
          will take it seriously. Moreover, there will be a spirit of innovation,
          a spirit of risk-taking, a willingness to take responsibility, and so
          on. So it is more fundamental to be happy with my work and to love what I do.

          One thing I got from this job is patience. I worked with teachers and students in
          classes. Since the students were still in kindergarten, I had to be as patient as
          possible to help them to learn. Another thing that I developed is the skill of
          communication. It is inevitable that people are in a mood. Sometimes the parents
          were not happy with the teachers and sometimes the teachers were not happy with
          the parents. At this time, it is my job to have a conversation with parents or
          teachers. I think the keys to communication are being patient, thinking in
          another place, and then giving positive feedback. The not happy problems
          in the job could usually be solved by communication.
