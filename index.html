        Working in the business development department, my main responsibility
        was data screening and analysis by Excel. In some projects, my job was
        to communicate with business managers. <br> <br>
        I have learned a lot from this internship. First thing is that focus on
        solving the problems instead of complaining about the person who made
        them. Second, I learned how to work happily and live seriously. Why
        not work seriously and live happily? In my opinion, The reason
        why many people think it should be written as 'serious work' is that
        traditionally, people see work as a task, a chore. So, one has to force
        oneself to be responsible. But, if people love their work, they
        will take it seriously. Moreover, there will be a spirit of innovation,
        a spirit of risk-taking, a willingness to take responsibility, and so
        on. So it is more fundamental to be happy with my work and to love what I do.

        Mainly responsible for feedback on students’ learning situation to parents,

        One thing I got from this job is patience. I worked with teachers and students in
        classes. Since the students were still in kindergarten, I had to be as patient as
        possible to help them to learn. Another thing that I developed is the skill of
        communication. It is inevitable that people are in a mood. Sometimes the parents
        were not happy with the teachers and sometimes the teachers were not happy with
        the parents. At this time, it is my job to have a conversation with parents or
        teachers. I think the keys to communication are being patient, thinking in
        another place, and then giving positive feedback. The not happy problems
        in the job could usually be solved by communication.
